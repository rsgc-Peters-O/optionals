## Safely unwrapping optionals

To summarize, when you append the ! character to an optional variable, this is called *force-unwrapping*.

You are telling the Swift compiler:

"I know this optional contains a value. So, let me use it with a non-optional data type."

This should only be done inside a conditional where you have explicitly checked for a *nil* value:

As a more streamlined alternative, you can use *optional binding*.

Keep in mind what Uncle Ben told Peter Parker:
