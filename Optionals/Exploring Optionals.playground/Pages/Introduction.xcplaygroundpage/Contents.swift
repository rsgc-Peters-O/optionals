# Optionals

Swift is a language designed to help programmers write safer code â€“ to avoid common errors that lead to security holes or applications that crash.

A very common error made by programmers is a failure to anticipate the absence of a value in their program.

"*Optionals* are a special feature in Swift used to indicate that an instance of a variable may not have a value.

If an instance of a variable has no value associated with it, we say that it is *nil*."

By now you are familiar with Swift's basic data types:

* String
* Int
* Float
* Double
* Array
* Dictionary

"You can use *optionals* with any data type to signal that an instance is potentially **nil**."

(Quotes from **Swift Programming**, Mathias & Gallagher, 2015)
